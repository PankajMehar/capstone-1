# Creating the Perfect Playlist:
Optimizing Playlist Selection & Sequencing on Spotify

1. Playlist_generation (playlist_generation.ipynb) - Uses our predictive model and acoustic
 similarity methods to generate candidate tracks from a seed song and perform simulated
  annealing optimization to generate a final playlist
2. Dataset_creation - various iterations of our code to extract data from the Spotify API to 
be used in training our predictive model.
3. Raw_audio_and_acoustic_similarity - This folder contains code to extract raw-audio features,
different models to predict track popularity from raw-audio, code to calculate acoustic similarity based
on earth movers distance and vantage point.
4. Playlist_popularity_prediction - Models for predicting the popularity of playlist using  features from
spotify API
5. CSV_files - csv files used for different models in all the above folders.
6. Tracks - wav files of 3 songs used for demo.
